# AI-Driven Dynamic Pricing Engine

This project focuses on building an advanced dynamic pricing system
using Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning to optimize product
prices under uncertain and changing demand.

## Problem Statement
Fixed pricing strategies fail to adapt to demand fluctuations,
inventory constraints, and customer behavior, leading to revenue
and profit loss.

## Solution Overview
An AI-based pricing engine that:
- Learns price–demand relationships
- Dynamically selects optimal prices
- Improves decisions using reinforcement learning
- Considers fairness and price stability

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Reinforcement Learning
- FastAPI (backend)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend dashboard)

## Project Status
🚧 Phase 1: Market Simulation (In Progress)
